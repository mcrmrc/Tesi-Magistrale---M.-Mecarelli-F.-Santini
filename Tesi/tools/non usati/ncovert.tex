\section{NCovert}
NCovert allows you to hide your network file transfers across the Internet. 
By utilizing packet forgery, NCovert hides your file transfer by cloaking it in seemingly harmless data. 
Advanced features allow you to hide your true IP address, and with careful planning you can hide the target's true IP address as well.
